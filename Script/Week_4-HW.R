## Take surveys, remove the rows where weight is NA and add a column that contains the average weight of each species+sex combination to the full surveys dataframe. 
## Then get rid of all the columns except for species, sex, weight, and your new average weight column. 
## Save this tibble as surveys_avg_weight.

surveys_avg_weight <- surveys %>% filter(!is.na(weight)) %>% group_by(species_id, sex) %>% mutate(avg_weight = mean(weight)) %>% select(species_id, sex, weight, avg_weight)

##Take surveys_avg_weight and add a new column called above_average that contains logical values 
## stating whether or not a rowâ€™s weight is above average for its species+sex combination 
## (recall the new column we made for this tibble)

surveys_avg_weight <- surveys_avg_weight %>% mutate(above_avg = weight >avg_weight)
